# üê∂ **PetLovers**
This project focuses on the pet industry, which has seen significant growth in recent years. With pets becoming increasingly considered family members, the "pet market" has expanded to include a wide range of products and services tailored to animal care. In 2022, the pet market in Brazil saw a 14% growth, reaching a revenue of R$ 58.9 billion. This sector includes pet food, veterinary services, pet care, and the sale of pets themselves.

The project aims to provide a platform that helps businesses in the pet industry manage their customer and pet data efficiently, track products and services, and ultimately contribute to the growth of the pet care market. With the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer habits, this platform seeks to streamline operations and enhance the customer experience in this thriving market.
